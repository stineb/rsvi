modelling of flue and is_flue_drought with MODIS data and the land surface temperature

There are 3 main parts added for the modelling of flue based on remotely sensed reflectance data and the land-surface temperature. 
- 01_QualityControl.ipynb: The quality control of the data
- 02_MissingData.ipynb: The handelling of the missing data
- 03_Analysis.ipynb: The NDI/fLUE correlations, the clustering of sites based on the NDI and the modelling of fLUE/is_flue_drought.
